# Random Number Generation

This repository contains code files for generating random numbers and visualizing their distributions using Python and C++.


## Files

Plot_Graph.py: This Python script uses the Matplotlib library to plot graphs for different distributions. It includes sections for plotting a uniform real distribution, uniform integer distribution, normal distribution, exponential distribution, and Bernoulli distribution. Each section is commented out, and you can uncomment the section you want to plot. The graphs are displayed using plt.show().

Random_Numbers.cpp: This C++ program generates random numbers based on different distributions. It includes commented sections for generating values using a uniform real distribution, uniform integer distribution, normal distribution, exponential distribution, and Bernoulli distribution. You can uncomment the desired distribution section and adjust the parameters if needed. The generated values are printed to the console.



## Instructions

To compile and run the simulation program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. The Python script requires  Matplotlib, and the C++ program requires a C++ compiler.
3. Run the Python script Plot_Graph.py to visualize the distributions. Uncomment the desired section and comment out the other sections if needed.
4. Compile and run the C++ program Random_Numbers.cpp to generate random numbers. Uncomment the desired distribution section and adjust the parameters if necessary.

Note: Make sure to update the file paths in the Python script if your data files are stored in a different location.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed to suit your requirements.

Enjoy experimenting with random number generation and distribution visualization!
